# Dice-Roll
An app I created using the flutter framework and the Dart programming language.  


This app has a basic User Interface which uses the Stateless Widget as well as the Stateful Widget provided by Flutter. This app thought me about the various intricacies of the Dart Programming Language,

It has a roll dice button, clicking upon which uses a library provided by Dart called Math, which has a function called Random. This function generates a random number between 1 and 6 and upon the number received from the the function, the dice displays that number.

A demo of the app will be updated soon.
